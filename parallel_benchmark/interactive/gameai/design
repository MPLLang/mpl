Prepare a 45-minute talk
Each slide can have any amount of 3 types of content:
- Motivation
- Technical
- Related work

Student has two meters: stamina and knowledge
Committee members have two meters: confusion and patience

During talk:
- Committee members can ask questions
-- Motivation
-- Technical
-- Related work
- Answering questions
-- If on a future slide (random):
--- Skip (increases confusion of all)
--- Delay (decreases patience of all)
-- If on a previous slide (random):
--- Go back
--- Remind (decreases patience of asker)
-- No matter what:
--- Answer (requires knowledge)
--- Dodge (decreases patience of asker)

Each question has a timer. When timer expires, patience of all (especially asker) decreases.

Stamina decreases over time
Confusion increases with technical material, may increase or decrease otherwise.
Patience decreases somewhat through 45 minutes, quickly after

Other actions:
-- Water (increase stamina, decrease patience)
-- Pause (increase stamina(slightly)+knowledge, decrease confusion)

Student loses when any committee member's patience runs out.
Student wins after getting through a fixed amount of technical material.
