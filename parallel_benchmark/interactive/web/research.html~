<h1>Research Interests</h1>
<p>Things I'm currently working on or have recently worked on.</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Interactive programs:</b> Designing and implementing new techniques
and interfaces for writing interactive programs (e.g. console applications,
network applications, GUIs) based on the efficient update guarantees
of <a href="http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation">
Self-Adjusting Computation</a>.
</li>
<li> <b>Work Stealing:</b> Work stealing is an important technique for
balancing task loads in a parallel computation. However, commonly used
work stealing algorithms depend on potentially expensive memory fences
and atomic operations. Our work seeks to eliminate these operations.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Past Research</h2>
<p>For my undergrad thesis, I studied information flow control in concurrent
programs. Concurrent programs provide many challenges to proving
noninterference (the property that low-security outputs are independent of
high-security inputs), since in the presence of data races, outputs could
be affected by the timing of computations. We provide a static analysis for
noninterference in a language based on <a href="http://www.x10-lang.org">
X10</a>. The abstraction of <i>places</i> in X10 gives a convenient, 
high-level mechanism for linguistically separating data at varying security
levels, allowing both programmers and compilers to more easily reason about
security guarantees.</p>

<p>My thesis is linked below in the hope that someone wants to become the
sixth person (after my three thesis readers and two very dedicated friends)
to read it.</p>
