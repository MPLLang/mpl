<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>Hah, that's funny. I don't have time for hobbies. But when I do
find myself with a few minutes of free time (or, in some cases, while
I'm working), here's a partial list of things I do, or used to do.</p>

<p><b>Walking:</b> I like to walk, especially when I'm thinking about
something. Pacing in my office while thinking about research gets
boring, so sometimes my pacing will spill out into the hall, around
CMU, or even into Schenley Park. So if you see me walking around
muttering something, I'm not crazy. Or, at least, that's not why I'm
walking and muttering. Feel free to say hi.</p>

<p><b>Web Design:</b> Contrary to popular belief, the degree I'm
pursuing has nothing to do with making websites. At the risk of
confusing this point, however, I do design and build the occasional
website. This one, for instance. No, I won't make you a website.</p>

<p><b>Youth Rights:</b> For much of my life, I've been involved in the
youth rights movement, based on the idea that young people are people
who deserve respect and a voice in the community. Concrete
instantiations of this philosophy include lowering the voting and
drinking ages, and advocating reasonable, common-sense policies in
schools. I am a former president and former board member of the
National Youth Rights Association, a national non-profit organization
that fights for these causes. If you disagree (or agree) and want to
discuss, I'm always happy to talk about these issues. Be prepared for
a long, heated discussion.
</p>

<p><b>Singing:</b> I sang in choirs in high school and college (the
<a href="http://www.harvardgleeclub.org">Harvard Glee Club</a>) and
an <i>a capella</i> group, <a href="http://www.harvardgleeclub.org/lite">
Harvard Glee Club Lite</a>. Now, I mostly sing randomly around the house.
</p>


<h1>Favorite Programming Languages</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Functional:</b> OCaml (sorry CMU people)</li>
<li><b>Dynamic/Scripting:</b> Python</li>
<li><b>To use as a negative example:</b> C++</li>
<li><b>Esoteric:</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE">
    LOLCODE</a></li>
</ul>
