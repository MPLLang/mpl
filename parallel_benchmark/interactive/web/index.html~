<p>I'm a <script type="text/javascript">document.write(year())</script>
year grad student working
with <a href="http://www.umut-acar.org/">Umut Acar</a> in the Computer
Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. My research is
primarily in the semantics and efficient implementation of
interactive(/reactive) programs, though my broad interests span
programming language and computer science more generally. </p>

<p>Prior to this, in spring 2012, I graduated from Harvard University with
an AB in computer science and a secondary field in physics (translation:
BA and minor, respectively). My senior thesis
on information flow control was supervised by
<a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/index.html">Stephen Chong</a>.
