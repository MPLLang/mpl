<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p><b>Walking:</b> I like to walk, especially when I'm thinking about
something. Pacing in my office while thinking about research gets
boring, so sometimes my pacing will spill out into the hall, around
CMU, or even into Schenley Park. So if you see me walking around
muttering something, I'm not crazy. Or, at least, that's not why I'm
walking and muttering. Feel free to say hi.</p>

<p><b>Web Design:</b> Contrary to popular belief, the degree I'm
pursuing has nothing to do with making websites. At the risk of
confusing this point, however, I do design and build the occasional
website. This one, for instance. No, I won't make you a website.</p>

<p><b>Youth Rights:</b>
</p>


<h1>Favorite Programming Languages</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Functional:</b> OCaml (sorry CMU people)</li>
<li><b>Dynamic/Scripting:</b> Python</li>
<li><b>To use as a negative example:</b> C++</li>
<li><b>Esoteric:</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE">
    LOLCODE</a></li>
</ul>
