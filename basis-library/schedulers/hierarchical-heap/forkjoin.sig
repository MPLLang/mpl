  (* aggregate some intermediate results.  you can think of the arguments like
   the multiplication and unit operations of a group, along with an injection
   function from the integers.  reduce tabulates the integers from zero
   (inclusive) to "length" (exclusion), injects them into the group and then
   multiplies them up.

   "*" must be associative and the unit must really be the identity element of
   the group.  assuming these are true, reduce behaves according to the
   following equivalence:
     reduce _ m j u l = List.fold m u (List.tabulate (l, fn i => j i))

   maxSeq is the largest number of injections/multiplications that are run
   sequentially on a single processor.
