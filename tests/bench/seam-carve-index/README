This benchmark computes a seam-carving index, which is the order in which
pixels are removed. This allows us to efficiently generate any intermediate
image.

So, whereas the "seam-carve" benchmark really only removes one seam
(and this can be iterated to remove many seams), this benchmark is designed
to carve out many seams.
